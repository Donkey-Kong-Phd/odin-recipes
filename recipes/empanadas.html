        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Empanadas are the best thing in the entire universe! I love them with all my heart, as much as I love my grandma, which made these with a lot of care before she got sick.</p>
        <p>This is a simple recipe that serves 12(!) people, and is best accompanied by a glass of apple juice, preferably from a packet. It's best eaten fresh, but wait a little bit before digging in, because the filling gets really hot!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Pastry</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>6 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted</li>
            <li>¼ cup margarine, melted</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Filling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
            <li>¼ cup salted butter</li>
            <li>2 medium onions, chopped</li>
            <li>2 stalks green onions, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 ½ medium red bell peppers, seeded and chopped</li>
            <li>⅔ pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>3 large hard-boiled eggs, peeled and chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 1</h4>
                <p> Stir potatoes, sour cream, cream cheese, 1 tablespoon butter, egg yolk, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper together in a bowl until smooth. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 2</h4>
                <p>Heat olive oil in a cast iron skillet or nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Add ground lamb, reduce heat to medium, and cook, stirring frequently, until browned and crumbly, 4 to 5 minutes. Pour off excess grease and season lamb with salt and black pepper to taste. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 3</h4>
                <p> Stir tomatoes with juice, onion, and carrot into ground lamb; simmer until vegetables are tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Add peas, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring frequently, until peas are warmed, 2 to 3 minutes. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 4</h4>
                <p> Heat beer in a saucepan over medium heat; add beef bouillon. Cook and stir beer mixture until bouillon is dissolved, about 5 minutes. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 5</h4>
                <p> Heat remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a separate pan over medium-low heat until sizzling. Whisk flour into butter until thick and paste-like, about 1 minute. Stir beer mixture and Worcestershire sauce into flour mixture until gravy is smooth and thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir gravy into lamb mixture and simmer until mixture is thickened, at least 5 minutes. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 6</h4>
                <p> Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Grease a 9x12-inch baking dish. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 7</h4>
                <p> Pour lamb mixture into the prepared baking dish. Carefully spoon mashed potatoes over lamb mixture, covering like a crust. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese, parsley, and paprika over mashed potatoes. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 8</h4>
                <p> Broil in the preheated oven until crust is browned and cheese is melted, 4 to 5 minutes. Cool for about 5 minutes before serving. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
