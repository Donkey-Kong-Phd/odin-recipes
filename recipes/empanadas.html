        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Empanadas are the best thing in the entire universe! I love them with all my heart, as much as I love my grandma, which made these with a lot of care before she got sick.</p>
        <p>This is a simple recipe that serves 12(!) people, and is best accompanied by a glass of apple juice, preferably from a packet. It's best eaten fresh, but wait a little bit before digging in, because the filling gets really hot!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Pastry</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>6 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted</li>
            <li>¼ cup margarine, melted</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Filling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
            <li>¼ cup salted butter</li>
            <li>2 medium onions, chopped</li>
            <li>2 stalks green onions, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 ½ medium red bell peppers, seeded and chopped</li>
            <li>⅔ pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>3 large hard-boiled eggs, peeled and chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 1</h4>
                <p> Combine water and salt in a small saucepan over medium heat and warm through, stirring until salt is dissolved. Remove from heat and let cool for 2 to 3 minutes. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 2</h4>
                <p> Combine sifted flour and melted margarine in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until crumbly. Add salt water gradually to the food processor and pulse until a soft dough ball forms that easily separates from the edge of the bowl. Add more water, 1 teaspoon at a time, only if needed. Press dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 3</h4>
                <p> Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil and grease with vegetable oil. Set aside. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 4</h4>
                <p> Bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Add cubed potatoes and cook until soft, 8 to 10 minutes. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 5</h4>
                <p> Meanwhile, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onions and green onions until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add red peppers and cook for 5 more minutes. Add ground beef and stir with a wooden spoon until fully browned, about 5 minutes. Season with salt, cayenne pepper, cumin, and paprika. Remove from heat. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 6</h4>
                <p> Drain potatoes and add to filling. Toss in chopped eggs and let filling cool down for a few minutes. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 7</h4>
                <p> Remove pastry from the fridge and knead gently on a floured surface. Divide dough in half and roll out each piece to 1/8-inch thickness. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 8</h4>
                <p> Cut out 3-inch circles with a pastry cutter or sharp knife and wet the edges lightly with water. Add 1 large tablespoon of filling in the center of each disc. Fold pastry over, press edges together, and seal with a fork. Transfer empanadas to the prepared baking sheet. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 9</h4>
                <p> Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool just a little before serving. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
