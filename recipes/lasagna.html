        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>When I was a preteen, my grandma used to bake me this sheperd's pie when we had the money for it. Now, I want to share this recipe with the internet, because I love this pie, and I love my grandma.</p>
        <p>This is a simple recipe that serves 4 people, and is best accompanied by a glass of apple juice, preferably from a packet. It's best eaten fresh, but wait a little bit before digging in.</p>
