            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 1</h4>
                    <p> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 2</h4>
                    <p> Make cookies: Beat together white sugar, butter, and eggs in a large bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Combine flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl; stir into creamed butter mixture until dough holds together. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 3</h4>
                    <p> Mix together white sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl until well combined. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 4</h4>
                    <p> Form dough into balls (about 2 teaspoons in each ball), then roll in cinnamon-sugar coating. Place dough balls about 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheet. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 5</h4>
                    <p> Bake in the preheated oven on the center rack for 7 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. </p>
